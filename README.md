# yolo-v8-Playing-Cards-Object-Detection

A personal project on playing cards detection using yolo v8. Built for learning purposes. 

- The primary aim for the project was to create my own dataset, however labelling every single image for a deck of cards was quite time consuming
- The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle which was further used for training and testing purposes
- The project does not include validation of the model, it only revolves around training and testing
- The project can successfully detect the playing card type and with a satisfying average accuracy of around 86%
- There are still features that may be added for the same project, for instance Counting cards
- The whole project was done using Python and carried out on google colaboratory
